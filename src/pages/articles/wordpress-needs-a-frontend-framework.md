The complexity of websites is growing exponentially. Whether you feel that is a good thing or a bad thing doesn't change that and Wordpress is not immune. Although commonly thought of as only a blogging platform, the company I work for and thousands of other use it for so much more. With this growing complexity frameworks, tools, and even new languages have been created to help manage it. However, Wordpress does not have a story around how these new tools fit into developing for their platform. That is what I want to help fix.
