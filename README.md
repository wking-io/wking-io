# Cool [WIP](https://www.wking.io/): The one year later "Coming Soon" Personal Website
This is the Work In Progress that is my personal website. I have said on my old site that I had an update "Coming Soon" for about a year now and I am done with that. 

About a week ago I actually started updating my site after stumbling on Gatsby while listening to [@wesbos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) and [@stolinsky](https://twitter.com/stolinski)'s podcast [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/). A week later I realized I can get this up and running really quick, but will need help refining and optimizing my code.

- I think I want to copy the layout of the home page to all pages as a uniform header and want to make a more reusable component for that.
- Styled Components
- Prettier
